SuperTalent is designed to create a bridge between **Job Providers** and **Job Seekers**.
It allows users to:

- Manage their own added and accepted jobs from a secure dashboard.

The goal is to make job searching and hiring fast, easy, and trustworthy.





# Apps Features

**Real-time Notifications:**
Toast messages via `react-hot-toast` & `react-toastify` for smooth UX.

**Modern Animations:**

**Sweet Alerts:**
Confirmation alerts for deleting or updating jobs using `SweetAlert2`.
